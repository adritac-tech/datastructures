# Queues 
* Reverse polish notation uses the operator at the end of the statement (so 4 + 2 would be 4 2 +)
* Linked lists are arrays of objects 
* Queues are created from objects in a linked list

# Sorts and Analysis 
* Bubble sort = sorts that swap adjacent elements 
* Insertion sorts are less effecient but they sort by doing two groups (sorted and unsorted)
* Merge sorting is dividing the total group in two and sorting each group and then continuing to divide 

# Week 0
* Programs are a combination of algorithms and data structures
* Paradigm: Approach or a methodology or a strategy to be followed for writing software applications
* Imperative Programming: Programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state
* Object Oriented Programming: Programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects

# Week 1

* Head refers to the front of the queue, tail refers to the end of the queue
* Heads and Tails change based on how many objects are in queue
* Building a stack reverses the order of a queue
* Circular refer to the first in first out idea, so that the queue links up in a ring

# Week 2
* Uses reverse polish notation which separates out operations from numbers and rearranges them
* Integers get turned into tokens (seem to be similar to objects) which are then moved around because of the reverse polish notation
* Need to use different testers (drivers) that simulate possible expressions 
* Define operators and create tokenizer
