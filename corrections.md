    <td> 1 </td>
    <td> I didn't follow PEMDAS when doing the computation </td>
  <tr>
    <td> 3 </td>
    <td> Casting should happen earlier in the process, the division of two ints is an int </td>
  <tr>
    <td> 5 </td>
    <td> The constructor can have a new signature </td>
   <tr>
    <td> 6 </td>
    <td> Casting should happen when the numbers are first defined </td>

    <td> Error with Boolean logic </td>
   <tr>
    <td> 9 </td>
    <td> The method only takes in one parameter </td>
   <tr>
    <td> 10 </td>
    <td> The PEMDAS logic I followed was incorrect </td>

   <tr>
    <td> 12 </td>
